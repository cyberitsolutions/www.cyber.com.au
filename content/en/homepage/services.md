## Consulting and Systems Integration

Businesses are increasingly moving office IT systems online to hosted services and cloud-based solutions, enabling more flexibility for staff and leveraging the savings of infrastructure consolidation.

Cyber IT Solutions provide consulting services on all aspects of your business' IT requirements. We ensure your IT solutions follow a consistent strategy and direction while eliminating unnecessary expenditure.

Our team of engineers can seamlessly integrate your Linux and open source solutions with existing legacy and third-party business-critical systems.

We have comprehensive design and hands-on expertise in the integration and management of most core open source system technologies.

### Systems Support and Maintenance

We provide on-call ad-hoc support services as well as deterministic Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and proactive maintenance agreements. Many of our customers enjoy the certainty and confidence provided by our 24x7 monitoring of their systems.

Our team of experienced systems engineers provide solutions to the most complex security issues, taking a disciplined approach to the analysis of known and potential vulnerabilities, mitigating against threats, and protecting your systems against further risk.

Cyber IT Solutions offers proactive maintenance agreements which include regular security-related updates to system software on your Linux systems, giving you assurance that newly discovered system vulnerabilities will be patched quickly, and minimising exposure to hostile attack.
